# volleyballstatistics
My IB Computer Science Dossier project designed to track and (kind of) store stastistics

-------------------------------------------VERSION 1.0 APRIL 8, 2020-------------------------------------------
This program is designed to track and store volleyball statistics. This was my first real dive into GUI on something big. It turned out... interesting. In the process of making this, I got a pretty bad concussion and wasn't able to do anything, let alone work on my code, for about a month and a half. Had I been able to work on this for all of that time, the end product may have been a tad more polished. The product does work, yet some features are not functioning. Currently, there is no way to store and retrieve games. There is also no way to look at a certain players cumulative statistics over multiple games. Both of whicb I set out to accomplish when designing the product. If I ever were to revisit this project and add more features, I would add in player substitutions, as well as the rotational update on screen. All in all, the product isn't awful, after a solid 4 months total of java instruction and practice, it's not that bad of a result. 

Included in the repository, find all individual classes along with the .JAR file.
